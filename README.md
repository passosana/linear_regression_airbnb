# linear_regression_airbnb
linear regression model applied to db extracted from airbnb to predict a unit's price

This is an example of the application of a linear regression model done by me in a database shared on kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/allanbruno/airbnb-rio-de-janeiro?resource=download) 
extracted from airbnb's website. 

This is a work in progress and I'll be uploading the most recent file as I go. 

You will see comments made throughout the notebook in which I explain the line of thought I used throughout the model.
